Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,ainsworth2010b | kiernan1997,2,1,-1.4879469,53.3809409,united kingdom,French,Language & Linguistics,"e-science | medieval studies | software/tool design and development | collaborative digital scholarship | annotation systems | digitisation - theory and practice | GLAM: galleries, libraries, archives, museums | project design"11,"Anderson, Steve F.",2007,anderson2007,community_0,community_0,0,Aporias of the Digital Avant-Garde,University of Southern California,United States of America,"This article maps two divergent trajectories within a narrowly defined sphere of short-form, time-based digital media created between 1995 and 2005.

In this study, we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways. Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or lowest common denominator results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close attention to its methodological and critical limitations.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,argamon2003 | bldr2005 | joachims1999 | koppel2002 | parallel_gpdt | philologic2007 | philomine2007 | ruiz1998 | svm_light | weka3 | zanni2003 | zanni2006,12,1,-87.6270059,41.8348731,united states,"Digital Library Development Center,",Information Science & Library Science,"machine learning/reading | genre-specific studies: prose, poetry, drama, song, comic/graphic | text mining | corpus linguistics | gender studies | african american studies | philology"42,"Argamon, Shlomo | Goulain, Jean-Baptiste | Horton, Russell | Olsen, Mark",2009,argamon2009b,community_7,community_6,0,Vive la Diff•À_rence!

The sets of words that were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models trained in gender classification on selections from the British National Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality.

By foregrounding the impossibility of ever fully resolving the human experience of computational space, the memento mortem mortis in these anamorphic games gestures toward experiential domains altogether indifferent to human phenomenology to create allegories of the beyond.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | bogost2012 | bolter1999 | bryant2010 | caillois2001 | clark1998 | damisch1995 | deleuze1986 | friedberg2006 | galloway2006a | hansen2006a | harman2002 | harpold2009 | henderson1984 | iwata2011 | kirsh1994 | lacan1998 | mccormick2011 | meillassoux2008 | mitchell1994b | nideffer2007 | oliver2009 | pliny | panofsky1996 | seaman2000 | sony2008 | tenbosch2011 | thacker2010,28,1,-73.894944,41.686662,united states,Media,Art,digital art | gaming/ game studies | philosophy | interface and user experience design | new/digital media studies | content analysis | immersive environments | virtual and augmented reality | media studies77,"Borgman, Christine L.",2009,borgman2009,community_4,community_1,5,The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities,UCLA,United States of America,"The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure •À_•À_•À_ all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are called to action with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?",Digital Humanities Quarterly,ainsworth2009b | adho2009 | anderson2004 | jacobsandwalsh2004 | arxiv2009 | arzberger2004 | atkins2007 | atkins2003 | ayers2003 | bailey2005 | baker2009a | bates1996a | bates1996b | bates1993 | bates1995 | bell2009 | bollen2008 | borgman1999 | borgman2000 | borgman2007 | borgman2009a | borgman2008 | borgman2007b | buckland1991 | case2006 | cclearn2009 | choudhury2008 | choudhury2007 | crane2006f | crane2007a | crane2001 | creative2009 | cronin2005 | foundation2005 | david2003 | davidspence2003 | odh2009 | manifesto2008 | doaj2009 | doar2008 | drucker2009b | duguid2009 | ebird2009 | edwards2007 | ecai2009 | eprints2010 | foster2009 | friedlander2008 | friedlander2009 | frischer2009 | galison1997 | gray2005 | gray2002 | greenstein2004 | hamma2009 | hey2009a | hoofnagle2009 | hypercities2009 | iath | ivanhoe2009 | jaschik2008 | jaschik2007 | jpmc2000 | jsah2009 | kanfer2000 | king2006a | bollen2010 | board2005 | lynch2002 | lynch2003a | lynch1995 | mahoney2002 | manovich2009a | marchionini1994 | mass2006 | mith2009 | monastersky2005 | nctm2009 | ninch2002 | nunberg2009 | oecd2007 | oerc2009 | olson2000 | oaip2009 | opencontent | opencit2009 | opened2009 | panstarrs2009 | pea2003 | crane2009d | poe2001 | presner2010 | presner2009a | pb2009 | reedijk2008 | committee2002 | rpe2009 | rice2008 | rome2009 | samuelson2009 | scheiner2004 | sc2009 | swaw3c2009 | save2009 | sherpa2009 | siegfried1993 | sloan2006 | smith2002c | stone1982 | src2009a | src2009b | szalay2008 | educause2009 | effect2009 | facts2005 | thierstein2009 | tibbo2003 | thl2009 | ukrc2009 | ucgbs2009 | ukda2009 | ucps2009 | unsworth2006 | vanhouse2004 | vectors2009 | whalen2009 | wiberley2003 | wiberley1994 | willinsky2006 | willinsky2009,130,1,-118.4451811,34.068921,united states,Information Studies,Information Science & Library Science,digital humanities - institutional support | digital humanities - nature and significance | cyberinfrastructure | e-science | digital humanities - pedagogy and curriculum | digital publishing | interdisciplinary collaboration | digital scholarship121,"Bradley, John",2012,bradley2012,community_4,community_1,0,"Towards a Richer Sense of Digital Annotation: Moving Beyond a ""Media"" Orientation of the Annotation of Digital Objects",King's College London,United Kingdom,"Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the practice of annotation. Whereas many in the digital humanities look at annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider annotation•À_•À_s already established function in scholarship: to support the development of an interpretation of a body of material. It begins by applying a •À_•À_•À_software application•À_•À_ perspective to annotation and it notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation development application that aims to support the reader•À_•À_s thinking. Once this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is useful to re-conceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern University•À_•À_s WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where the application•À_•À_s data model •À_•À_•À_ with its inherent semantic significance •À_•À_•À_ is available to be annotated.

There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos, 3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms: PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search engines. However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article. In this paper we introduce the Xpos•À_•À_re tools for authoring and displaying an interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author or institution•À_•À_s website in order to share related research products and to achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this software in a few research projects. The Xpos're software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a Flash-based document reader and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the Xpos're HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated slides and which can be highly customized by the user.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,alsudani2009 | aalbersberg2012 | bentum2009 | bernard2002 | borgman2007 | breure2011 | dietrich2012 | dillon1989 | dyson2004 | force11 | gerber2009 | hunter2007 | jankowski2009 | kjellberg2010 | lagoze2007 | nimwegen1999 | pettifer2011 | phillips2009 | puschmann2012 | santosa2011 | tatum2011 | wouters2012 | ziegler2011,23,1,5.1226018,52.0901527,netherlands,Digital Humanities,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",multimedia | semantic web | software/tool design and development | user studies / user needs | publishing and delivery systems | digital publishing | digital scholarship | project design40,"Brown, Susan | Clements, Patricia | Grundy, Isobel | Ruecker, Stan | Antoniuk, Jeffery | Balazs, Sharon",2009,brown2009a,community_9,community_1,1,Published Yet Never Done: The Tension Between Projection and Completion in Digital Humanities Research,University of Guelph | University of Alberta | University of Alberta | University of Alberta | University of Alberta | University of Alberta,Canada | Canada | Canada | Canada | Canada | Canada,"The case of the Orlando Project offers a useful interrogation of concepts like completion and finality, as they emerge in the arena of electronic publication.

In this essay, we argue that these tensions stem from a general misunderstanding of the kinds of work that goes into producing scholarship in multimedia form.

We argue that while traditional ideas of what counts as scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical labor, and print over digital media, new media•À_•À_s functional (and in some cases even biological) difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material labor.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | andersen2004 | ball2004 | bolter2000 | burgess2003 | coover2002 | coover2008 | drucker2002b | easterling1992 | grusin1996 | gutierrez | hansen2000 | hansen2006a | haraway2004b | hayles1999a | hayles1999 | hayles2002 | hayles2005 | hockey2000 | hocks2003 | ifbook | kendrick2001 | kirschenbaum2008 | kittler1999 | latour1993 | latour1999 | mccarty2005 | mcgann2004b | markley2001 | mitchell2008 | mitchell2003b | ogorman2005 | ogorman2006 | pickering1995 | strain2003 | strain2004 | tuana2001 | vannatta2005 | wardrip2009b,39,1,-76.9425543,38.9869183,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,authorship attribution / authority | collaborative digital scholarship | multimedia | resource creation and discovery | media studies | new/digital media studies92,"Butts, J.J.",2011,butts2011,community_1,community_4,0,Missed Connections: The Collective Novel and the Metropolis,Wartburg College,United States of America,"This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important modernist precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a literary form, particularly popular during the 1930s, that explores a wide context through a decentered narrative. Previous discussions of these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form in proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the form in concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates our understanding. Drawing on examples from novels by John Dos Passos, Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, William S. Rollins, Jr., and Josephine Herbst it shows how these texts offered not only radically ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic view of the possibilities of political community, extending at times to specific critiques of communist politics.

Ultimately, I argue, digital interactives are part of a new exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways of considering an artifact•À_•À_s essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our understanding of human effort, intentionality, and embodiment in a digital age.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,allyn1987 | antrim2009 | ballard2006 | barraclough1988 | bearman1996 | bedos-rezak2000 | benjamin1978b | bolter1999 | bosshard1994 | bowen1993 | brannock2009 | brazer2001 | brenner2009 | brown2006c | callender2002 | cannon2000 | casterline1980 | clanchy1993 | cohen2010d | cotter2010 | darvick1985 | defense2007 | dekeyser2006 | dierking1998 | testbed2003 | dilevko2003 | dutka2002 | everhart1989 | foucault1980 | foucault1990 | gaur1992 | gordon1994 | griffiths2003 | grusin2006 | halliwell2003 | haraway1997 | haraway2004a | hayles1999 | harvard1987 | harvey1996 | hedstrom2002 | hedstrom2006 | heidegger1992 | henning2006 | hill1986 | keene1998 | kemp1997 | king2009b | lenoir2002 | levenson1998 | light2010 | macdonald1998 | madigan1930 | manovich2001 | mccutcheon1925 | mellor2002 | miller2010a | mintz1994 | morris1995a | morris2006 | morrissey1991 | neef2006b | vandijck2006 | nicholls2003 | olyanova1929 | ong1982 | osborne1997 | otoole2006 | pearce-moses2008 | ponot2002 | prior2003 | reagan2003 | rice1927 | reed1995 | rigg1905 | rose1994 | rothenberg1995 | rothstein2008 | schwartzburg2010 | sell2010 | shaddy2000 | silver1967 | sinon2010 | stevenson1994 | snyder1990 | swade1998 | tedeschi1997 | thomas1998 | thornton1996 | waldby2000 | weil2002 | williams2012 | witcomb2006 | wolfe2009 | woodward2003,95,1,-97.7327641,30.2806543,united states,Philosophy,Philosophy,"cultural studies | GLAM: galleries, libraries, archives, museums | philology | new/digital media studies | authorship attribution / authority | historical studies | media history [history of the book]"113,"Ciccoricco, David",2012,ciccoricco2012,community_0,community_0,2,"The Materialities of Close Reading: 1942, 1959, 2009",University of Otago,New Zealand,"This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary study.

This paper will discuss a case study that uses theories of knowledge representation and research on phonetic and prosodic symbolism to develop analytics and visualizations that help readers discover aural and prosodic patterns in literary texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe the theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and prosodic symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality incorporated in our project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected in our use of OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features; in the flow we coordinated to pre-process texts in SEASR•À_•À_s Meandre, a data flow environment; in the instance-based predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and in ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to allow readers to discover aural features across literary texts.

Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorne•À_•À_s short story, The Celestial Railroad, in the nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorne•À_•À_s early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorne•À_•À_s works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeks•À_•À_ work in digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This social text of The Celestial Railroad, Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of The Celestial Railroad using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of The Celestial Railroad, for instance, indicate that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,anonymous1869 | anonymous1861 | anonymous1855 | anonymous1851 | anonymous1850 | anonymous1845 | anonymous1843a | anonymous1843b | belasco2011 | brown2004 | bryant2011 | clark1978 | clement2011 | conway1902 | conway1882 | cordell2012 | cordell2012b | crowley1974 | d1847 | earhart2011b | finn2011 | fisher1874 | flanders2009 | garvey2006 | griswold1847 | hawthorne1987 | hawthorne1846 | hawthorne1844a | hawthorne1843a | hawthorne1843b | hawthorne1843c | hawthorne1843d | hawthorne1843e | hawthorne1843f | hawthorne1843g | hawthorne1843h | hawthorne1843i | hawthorne1843j | hawthorne1843k | hawthorne1843l | hawthorne1843m | hawthorne1835 | hawthorne1836 | hawthorne1844b | hawthorne1860 | hawthorne1850 | kazin1997 | little1843 | mcgann2001a | mcgill2003 | moretti2005 | mueller2012 | ngram2012 | nord2004 | nunberg2010 | nunberg2009 | raabe2011 | tanner1846 | thomas2011 | thorne-murphy2010 | tuveson1968 | walsh2008 | weeks1826 | wood1855 | midnight1843 | signs1843 | visit1843 | christian1848 | evangelist1852 | advocate1869,70,1,-71.0891717,42.3398067,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,digital archives | literary studies | historical studies | bibliographic methods / textual studies | information retrieval | semantic analysis | digitisation - theory and practice | text analysis34,"Crane, Gregory | Babeu, Alison | Bamman, David | Breuel, Thomas | Cerrato, Lisa | Deckers, Daniel | L•À_deling, Anke | Mimno, David | Singhal, Rashmi | Smith, David A. | Zeldes, Amir",2009,crane2009a,community_8,community_1,0,Classics in the Million Book Library,Tufts University | Tufts University | Tufts University | Technical University of Kaiserslautern | Tufts University | Hamburg University | Humboldt-University | University of Massachusetts | Tufts University | University of Massachusetts | Humboldt-University,United States of America | United States of America | United States of America | Germany | United States of America | Germany | Germany | United States of America | United States of America | United States of America | Germany,"In October 2008, Google announced a settlement that will provide access to seven million scanned books while the number of books freely available under an open license from the Internet Archive exceeded one million.

This movement •À_•À_•À_ visible in online book clubs such as Infinite Summer and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend of blogs-to-books publication •À_•À_•À_ is a reaction against superficial increasingly brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital culture•À_•À_s narrative depravation, the deep reading revival has reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies corroborating Nicholas Carr•À_•À_s claim in The Shallows (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support of radial reading as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the Internet has threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically provided the media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading it threatens to obliterate.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,bauerlein2008 | baron2013 | boynton2013 | briggs2011 | brown2012 | star | caneandalves2001 | carreiro2010 | carr2011 | chabrisandsimons2009 | chee2010 | collins2010 | collins2013 | coscarelli2009 | dediu2012 | destefanoandlefevre2007 | dowling2010 | dowling2011 | dretzin2010 | gillmor2006 | greenfield2009 | griswoldetal2005 | habermas1974 | harkaway2012 | helfand2001 | howe2012 | howe2009 | isidore2012 | infinitesummer2009 | jenkins2010 | jenkins2006 | jenkins2013 | jeongandfishbein2007 | johnson2006 | kohut2012 | konstantinou2012 | kovarik2011 | peters2012 | lanier2010 | lessig2008 | levy2007 | librarything2013 | liu2005 | longform2011 | malone2012 | many1996 | mcluhan1965 | mcgann1991 | mcgann2001 | miller2007 | moody2012 | nakamura2012 | facebook2012 | nielsen2006 | nielsen2008 | okker2003 | ophiretal2009 | papacharissi2009 | pedersen2009 | perlmutteranddowling2012 | phamandsarno2010 | redman1997 | shirky2009 | silver2012 | soffer2012 | sontag2007 | sonvilla-weiss2010 | staley2003 | striphas2009 | npr2012 | turkle2011 | turner2001 | walther2008 | harlequin2014 | outlander2014,75,1,-91.5548998,41.6626963,united states,Journalism and Mass Communication,Communication,"Internet / World Wide Web | cultural studies | collaboration | narratology | immersive environments | media history [history of the book] | hypertext | digitization - theory and practice | reading methodologies - close, distant, deep"1,"Drucker, Johanna",2007,drucker2007,community_7,community_3,0,"Philosophy and Digital Humanities: A review of Willard McCarty, Humanities Computing (London and NY: Palgrave, 2005)",University of Virginia,United States of America,A review of Willard McCarty's Humanities Computing.,Digital Humanities Quarterly,hockey2000 | mcgann2001a | sutherland1997 | schreibman2004,4,1,-78.5079772,38.0335529,united states,Information Studies,Information Science & Library Science,history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities | philosophy | digital humanities - nature and significance48,"Drucker, Johanna",2009,drucker2009, ,isolate_928,0,"A Review of Matthew Kirschenbaum, Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination Cambridge, MA and London, UK: MIT University Press, 2008",University of California,United States of America, ,Digital Humanities Quarterly, ,0,1,-118.4451811,34.068921,united states,Information Studies,Information Science & Library Science,new/digital media studies | digital literary studies | bibliographic methods / textual studies | resource creation and discovery | digital literacy91,"Drucker, Johanna",2011,drucker2011,isolate_6,isolate_1745,2,Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,University of Virginia,United States of America,"As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,anderson2008 | anderson2007a | carden | griethe2006 | jones2008 | knorr1990 | lochlann2010 | latour1986 | lynch1988 | maceachren2005 | porter1995 | shneiderman2005 | skeels2008 | wells2008,14,1,-118.4451811,34.068921,united states,Information Studies,Information Science & Library Science,visualisation | software/tool design and development | new/digital media studies | digital humanities - nature and significance143,"Drucker, Johanna",2013,drucker2013,community_0,community_3,0,Performative Materiality and Theoretical Approaches to Interface,UCLA,United States of America,"This article outlines a critical framework for a theory of performative materiality and its potential application to interface design from a humanistic perspective. Discussions of the materiality of digital media have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on which a model of performative materiality is based.

Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today •À_•À_•À_ within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter B•À__rger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists). While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that dialectic.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aciman2009 | bigelow2008 | biggs2007 | burger1984 | coover1992 | drucker2005 | eloai2010 | foster1996 | gallix2008 | greenberg1960 | koskimaa2010 | mcnamara2007 | marinetti1909 | miller1998 | pressman2008 | raley2002a | ranci•À_•À_re2004 | rettberg2008 | ricardo2009 | rich2008 | rosenberg1968 | rosenberg1996 | stefans2000 | wardrip2009a | zuern2009,25,1,15.590715,56.182307,sweden,Planning and Media Design,Planning & Development,digital literary studies | history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities | media studies | digital publishing | historical studies | multimedia | new/digital media studies190,"Hoyt, Eric | Ponto, Kevin | Roy, Carrie",2014,eric2014,community_1,community_4,0,Visualizing and Analyzing the Hollywood Screenplay with ScripThreads,University of Wisconsin-Madison | University of Wisconsin-Madison | University of Wisconsin-Madison,United States of America | United States of America | United States of America,"Of all narrative textual forms, the motion picture screenplay may be the most perfectly pre-disposed for computational analysis.

First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart, then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,anderson1992 | blevins2005 | blevins2006 | corbett1993 | evans1989 | finkel2002 | finkel2007a | finkel2007b | finkel2009a | wikipedia2009a | matthews1972 | stump2001 | zwicky1985,13,1,-84.5039697,38.0306511,united states,Computer Science,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",natural language processing | linguistics | computer science | stylistics and stylometry | lexicography148,"Finn, Ed",2013,finn2013,community_1,community_4,0,Revenge of the Nerd: Junot D•À_az and the Networks of American Literary Imagination,Arizona State University,United States of America,"Junot D•À_az's writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and literary fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English and Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical categorization.

Thus far, it seems that the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general.

This article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of globalization.

In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare•À_•À_s works developed an implicit awareness of motives for doing history. We also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and students•À_•À_ experience of meaningful connections to material.

On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself. This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities.

Yet, despite the growing use of location-based technologies, authors and readers alike have been slow to take to site-specific narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of locative media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the narrative experience. This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are altering conceptions of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by radically expanding the sites where narratives can be accessed and experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of literary reading as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but confront several cultural and technological factors preventing such an enhanced emplacement of narrative, factors that current performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being transported to a remote fictional world interferes with readers' appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world, as well as the contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation through the actual world. At the technical level, the discontinuous algorithms of place that inform the architecture of most locative media systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across more extensive spaces. Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between conventionally sedentary modes of literary engagement and new modalities of mobility, a tension that is constitutive of our present mediality. The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek, a next-generation locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the user to actively form complex narrative links between real and fictional spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms of spatial play that neutralize both the spatial limitations of current locative media design and the sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of digital literature.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,amazon | barr2008 | benton2000 | bernstein2003a | bherer2009 | bogost2007 | boluk2011 | bull2005 | eaket2008 | emmott1998 | evans2010a | galloway2010 | gerrig1993 | giles2009 | green2004 | greenetal2004 | greenspan2011b | harvey2000 | hayles2005 | hight2010 | khaled2010 | klima2006 | knowltona | knowltonb | lovlie2009 | marin1984 | miall2001 | micallef2003 | mitchell1996 | murray1997 | ong2002 | philips2007 | pope2006 | pressman2007 | proboscis | raley2010 | rober2006 | rothbauer2009 | rueb2005 | rueb1996 | ryan2004 | ryan1980 | schafer2010a | spellman2004 | whitson2008,45,1,-75.6960202,45.3875812,canada,English,Language & Linguistics,"mobile applications and mobile design | narratology | reading methodologies - close, distant, deep | new/digital media studies | geospatial analysis | literary studies"194,"Grigar, Dene",2014,grigar2014,community_0,community_3,0,Curating Electronic Literature as Critical and Scholarly Practice,Washington State University Vancouver,United States of America,"Exhibits focusing specifically on Electronic Literature have been mounted at galleries, libraries, universities, convention spaces, and parks and other outside venues.

Prior to my interventions, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated manuscript texts had been multi-spectral imaging, which is prohibitively expensive, limiting its utility as a general research tool, although it is still sometimes in use. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical methodologies. The potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, has been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color levels, and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is more advanced than simple image enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly though, it remains far less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. The technique contributed to the recovery of nearly all of the obliterated text in the first two volumes of•À_The Court Journals and Letters of Frances Burney, which were published by Oxford University Press in 2011, and it was also used within in-progress volumes from•À_The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson.

Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the me or the embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment within contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does not operate from a position of erasure within social media networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in much current user-generated me-dia.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | andrews2003 | barlow1996 | bolter1991 | bolter2001 | bolter2003a | bruns2008a | burgessandgreen2009 | cayley2006 | hansen2006a | haraway1991 | hayles1999 | hayles2002 | jackson1995 | landow1992 | lange2009 | lanham1993 | lessig2004 | montfort2005 | murray1997 | petersandseier2004 | raley2002a | snickarsandvonderau2009 | stefans1999 | strickland2002 | thacker2004 | uribe2004,27,1,15.590715,56.182307,sweden,Communication and Culture,Cultural Studies,social media | virtual and augmented reality | new/digital media studies | cultural studies | user studies / user needs12,"Hoover, David",2007,hoover2007,community_5,community_2,1,"The End of the Irrelevant Text: Electronic Texts, Linguistics, and Literary Theory",New York University,United States of America,"The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about meanings and style.

This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists.

The argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of •À_•À_•À_quests•À_•À_ by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad 2001. I build upon and revise these theorists•À_•À_ understandings by approaching a •À_•À_•À_quest•À_•À_ as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchon•À_•À_s The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors.

Adventure was the first in a series of text-based games (interactive fiction) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for narrative encounters and as an aesthetic masterpiece of logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess the significance of Adventure remain incomplete without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to improve the gameplay.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | aarseth2001 | adams2007c | adams2007a | adams2007b | anderson1985 | anderson1990 | au2000 | au2002 | bennahum1998 | bloom2002 | briceno2000 | brucker2005 | brucker1976 | brucker2005a | brucker2005b | buckles1985 | cadre2004 | cahill2001 | carter2002 | chaplin2007 | cordella2001 | costikyan2007 | crowther1976 | crowther2001 | crowther2007 | crowther1975b | crowther1977 | dalenberg2004 | dalenberg2006 | dibbell2002 | douglass2006 | douglass2007 | eskelinen2001 | freeman1975 | gamespy2002 | gilbert2005 | gilbert2007 | gillogly1977 | hafner1994 | hafner1996 | harrington2007 | herz1997 | howell1990 | hutcheon1988 | jerz2000 | jerz2002 | jerz2005 | juul2001 | juul2005 | keller2007 | kidder1981 | kraley2004 | knuth1998 | lawrence2002 | levy1984 | mann2003 | mann2004 | mcgonigal2008 | montfort2003 | murray1997 | nss1994 | nelson2001 | oneill1990 | park1994 | plotkin1995 | poole2000 | raymond1996 | robinett2000 | rothstein2002 | ryan2001b | selfe2007 | schwartz1999 | toomey1990 | turkle1995 | vanvleck2001 | wilcox1990 | wilcox2002 | woods2006 | woods2007,80,1,-79.5556283,40.3115048,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,interactive fiction | mapping | critical code studies | gaming/game studies126,"Johnston, John",2012,johnston2012,community_1,community_2,0,Webbots and Machinic Agency,Emory University,United States of America,"Malware and criminal operations performed by botnets on the Internet not only pose a new threat, but also point to our increasing reliance upon a new form of machinic agency, which I call the webbot assemblage.

In light of the recent renaissance of computer-assisted statistical approaches to literary analysis, the present article charts in detail a formative period (1969-1973) during which this most important of novelists first adopted, then deconstructed, and eventually rejected one of the discipline•À_s earliest incarnations.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,attridge2004 | attwell1993 | beckett1959 | beckett1970 | beckett1984 | begam1992 | bloch1953 | burrows2002 | canepari-labib2005 | coetzee1963a | coetzee1963b | coetzee1969a | coetzee1969b | coetzee1969c | coetzee1971 | coetzee1973a | coetzee1973b | coetzee1974 | coetzee1977 | coetzee1978 | coetzee1980 | coetzee1986 | coetzee1997 | coetzee1999 | coetzee2002 | coetzee2003 | coetzee2005 | coetzee2007 | coetzee2013 | coetzeeandattwell1992 | craig1999 | egerer1999 | forsyth1999 | fromm2000 | head1997 | holmes2001 | jahn2007 | lamb2010 | kannemeyer2012 | kossew1996 | leavis1930 | mulhall2009 | paling2009 | phillips1998 | ramsay2011 | scott1997 | silvani2012 | stewart2003 | vanzantengallagher1991,49,1,-0.1308206,51.5229378,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,literary studies | history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities | text analysis181,"Kalvesmaki, Joel",2014,kalvesmaki2014,community_3,community_2,0,Canonical References in Electronic Texts: Rationale and Best Practices,Dumbarton Oaks,United States of America,"Systems of canonical references, whereby segments of written works are sequentially labeled with numbers or letters to facilitate cross-referencing, are widely used but seldom studied, undeservedly so. Canonical numbers are complex interpretive mechanisms with a great deal of potential for anyone editing and using electronic texts. In this essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in digital projects. After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR).

In this essay I argue that IF can be understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and ekphrastic textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which direct the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike traditional ekphrastic literature, however, IF also asks the player to take practical actions in response to the images he or she visualizes. During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most effective means available of providing players with immersive visual experiences. However, graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area. Therefore, in order to justify the continued existence of IF, contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the visuality of IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy for doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum, is to abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and textual qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a non-transparent way, because IF offers visual experiences which are user-generated rather than pre-rendered.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | baggett1994 | blank1980 | bolter2003b | bond2006a | chang2004 | chatman2004 | dibbell2001 | douglass2007a | drucker2002a | eve2007 | gaudreault2009 | heffernan2004 | hollander1995 | ingold2000 | jerz2007 | koelb2006 | krieger1992 | loguidice2004 | loizeaux2008 | mccloud1993 | mcgann1991 | mitchell1990 | mitchell1994a | mitchell2009a | montfort2000 | montfort2005 | nelson2001 | salen2003 | schwenger1999 | short2000 | short2002 | short2003 | short2008 | short2009 | wettlaufer2003 | whalen2008b | wikipedia2009 | wolf1997 | wolf2002,40,1,-82.3549302,29.6436325,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,gaming / game studies | media studies | new/digital media studies98,"Kashtan, Aaron",2011,kashtan2011b,community_2,community_0,0,Forward to the Past: Nostalgia for Handwriting in Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You,University of Florida,United States of America,"Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture often entail a nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of earlier writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video games. Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and The World Ends with You (2007), represent two alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and DS-specific equivalent.

A primary record, the MLA told us then, can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance (27). Today, the conceit of a primary record can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a physical object. Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records.

Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology. The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. Computation is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression. The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,abrams1953 | aitchison2003 | bell1999 | bentley1732 | berg2001 | borgman2007 | bottero2001 | cameron | carroll1992 | ceruzzi1998 | darwin1871 | fishbane1989 | franklin2001 | goodman1976 | greg1924 | grier2005 | grivelet1956 | gross2001 | hall1913 | hoenigswald1963 | hoenigswald1987 | housman1921 | johnson1765 | jones1948 | kac1999 | kay2000 | kenney1974 | kirschenbaum2008 | kraus2002 | lanham1991 | mahood1957 | manetti1993 | mcgann1991 | mcleod1983 | nisbet1991 | ohara1993 | ohara1996 | oppenheim1964 | poole2002 | ramsay2003 | ramsay2008 | rye2003 | salemans1996 | searls2001 | steiner1998 | sewell1952 | spolsky2002 | stoppard1997 | tarrant | tedlock2000 | thacker2004 | thomas2007b | welsford1966 | woolfson2005,54,1,-76.9425543,38.9869183,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,philology | semantic analysis | modeling | data mining / text mining129,"Kraus, Kari | Donahue, Rachel",2012,kraus2012,community_2,community_0,0,Do You Want to Save Your Progress?: The Role of Professional and Player Communities in Preserving Virtual Worlds,University of Maryland | University of Maryland,United States of America | United States of America,"Almost since the inception of the industry, the player community has been instrumental in preserving video games and other variable media art.

The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically noisy frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem, Tender Buttons; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of Tender Buttons in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that animates her wartime memoir Wars I Have Seen. Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames of signification.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,hazlitt1944 | bbc1945 | bush1945 | castells2000 | dydo2003 | times1944 | greenspan1999 | gonzalez2004 | meyer2001 | norton2004 | schwenger2001 | shannon1949 | shenk1997 | solomons1896 | stein1974 | stein1990a | stein1974a | stein1984 | vandusen1996 | whittier1999 | whittier2001 | wikipedia_surrender | will2004,23,1,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,English,Language & Linguistics,literary studies | historical studies | media studies | new/digital media studies | narratology | network science - theory and analysis | philology161,"Lindh•À_, Cecilia",2013,lindhe2013,community_6,community_0,0,A Visual Sense is Born in the Fingertips: Towards a Digital Ekphrasis,University of Ume•À_,Sweden,"In this article, the significance of the rhetorical and modern definitions of ekphrasis will be discussed through the lens of digital literature and art.

He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis.

Using a custom-made interface it records visual behavior: the non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments of distributed individuals. Users can be assigned to groups according to the qualities of their judgments. These qualities may be distilled from emerging similarity patterns. The implications of individual judgments in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging patterns can be assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures.

It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,ahds2006 | ahrc2006a | bergson1912 | birringer1999 | bolter2000 | butler1999 | century2005 | connolly2002 | delahunta2002 | derrida1995 | dixon2007 | flynn2002 | galloway2008 | giannachi2007 | gibson1979 | haraway1998 | imperiale2000 | kittler1999 | leatherbarrow2002 | manovich2001 | melville1994 | phelan1993 | rye2009 | poindexter2002 | ricoeur1999,25,1,-2.6029792,51.4584172,united kingdom,Arts,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",e-science | archives | new/digital media studies | interdisciplinary collaboration | spatio-temporal modeling176,"Piersma, Hinke | Tames, Ismee | Buitinck, Lars | van Doornik, Johan | Marx, Maarten",2014,piersma2014,community_2,community_3,0,War in Parliament: What a Digital Approach Can Add to the Study of Parliamentary History,"NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies | NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies | University of Amsterdam | University of Amsterdam | University of Amsterdam",Netherlands | Netherlands | Netherlands | Netherlands | Netherlands,"With the digitization of the parliamentary proceedings (Handelingen der Staten Generaal), the structuring of this body of data, and the development of an advanced search engine, we can apply new methods of historical research.

Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive, which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new features and tools, grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out alternate sources of support when early grants run out, maintain continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,bamboo2013 | system2012 | burgess2013 | croxall2011 | plans2012 | eaves2013 | eaves2006 | eaves2012 | fiormonte2010 | dhcenter2013 | kirschenbaum2009 | kirschenbaum2008 | leon2012 | mcgann2013 | nelson2012d | nowviskie2012 | scholars2012 | nowviskie2010 | pitti2004 | price2012 | ramsay2004 | scheinfeldt2012 | shaw2012 | siemens2010 | ucbconference2013 | vankleeck2012 | project2012,27,1,-77.8697741,34.225775,united states,Digital Humanities,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",collaborative editing | collaborative digital scholarship | digital archives | databases | interdisciplinary collaboration | digital humanities - facilities | project design85,"Reside, Doug",2010,reside2010, ,isolate_1650,0,"A review of Noah Wardrip-Fruin's Expressive Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games, and Software Studies",University of Maryland,United States of America,"The need for greater software literacy is a pressing problem, but one still not universally acknowledged even among those working in new media and digital humanities.

This format aims for conforming data that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to search for historical materials. While the project's graphical visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these improvements.

One may speak of end as in the supersession of one model of editing (the intentionalist, definitive-text model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of end as in aim: not only the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States.

He narrates that he had been aware of computing developments when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late 1970s that he took formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,raymond1993 | rockwell1998 | rockwell1999 | rockwell1994 | bradley1994,5,1,-113.5263186,53.5232189,canada,Philosophy,Philosophy,oral history | history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities | text analysis | visualization | philosophy | digital humanities - nature and significance123,"Rockwell, Geoffrey | Organisciak, Peter | Meredith-Lobay, Megan | Ranaweera, Kamal | Ruecker, Stan | Nyhan, Julianne",2012,rockwell2012b,community_4,community_1,0,The Design of an International Social Media Event: A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities,University of Alberta | University of Illinois | University of Alberta | University of Alberta | Illinois Institute of Technology | University College London,Canada | United States of America | Canada | Canada | United States of America | United Kingdom,"A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is a community documentation project that brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, typically March 18.

To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication.

Our experience suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for •À_•À_•À_done-ness•À_•À_ can be applied to them, and that decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary constraints and the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,bryant2000 | bryant2006 | flanders2007b | landow1991 | landow1992 | jackson1976 | crackel2007 | pierazzo2007 | wikipedia2007,9,1,-76.4460588,37.5512484,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,publishing and delivery systems | digital scholarship | digital publishing | digital humanities - nature and significance | project design177,"Shell, Erik",2014,shell2014,isolate_17,isolate_4272,0,"A review of Brett D.

There, whilst undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late Antonius Ampoli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised them.

He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates strongly the vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet.

This paper traces the steps taken in a collaborative research project that aimed to analyze newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in New York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was produced by converting original print sources and image files into digital texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated errors. We then corrected the scans and added document-level genre metadata. This allowed us to evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade procedures when we tested for possible differences in word usage across two key phases in the trial's coverage using log likelihood ratio . The same tests were run on each dataset •À_•À_•À_ the original OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through the addition of genre metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98% accuracy. Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of trial coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a substantial impact. This was true both when investigating all words and when testing for a subset of judgment words we created to explore the murder•À_•À_s emotive elements and its moral implications. Deeper analysis of this case, and others like it, will require more sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word sense and context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,archerforthcoming | arlitsch2004 | ayers2013 | baron2009 | dunning1993 | eder2013 | hitchcock2013 | holley2009 | kagan2009 | kilgarriff2001 | knoblock2007 | lopresti2008 | mcintyre2010 | moore2004 | nelson2010 | nelson2012 | newman2006 | obrien2010 | paquot2009 | powell2004 | rayson2000 | rice1993 | stein2006 | strange2010 | strapparava2008 | svensson2010 | tanner2009 | walker2010 | wiebe2005 | williams2011 | yang2011,31,1,149.118527,-35.2776999,australia,Classics,Classics,digitization - theory and practice | text mining | metadata | text analysis | historical studies | computer science | content analysis | project design182,"Sturm, Sean | Turner, Stephen Francis",2014,sturm2014,community_0,community_0,0,Digital Caricature,University of Auckland | University of Auckland,New Zealand | New Zealand,"For Vil•À_m Flusser, philosopher of technology, the advent of photography heralded the return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of written language.

The short answer to our question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing (""digital orthography"") and, secondly, as a caricature of thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, funny (""digital caricature"").",Digital Humanities Quarterly,aarseth1997 | adamek2010 | badiou2011 | benjamin2008 | berardi2011 | burks1949 | deacon1997 | dean2010 | decampos1962 | decauter2002 | deleuze2004 | deleuze1992 | deman1984 | derrida2004 | derrida1997 | devasathan2010 | diehl2009 | douris2012 | drucker2009 | drucker2001 | dumaurier2008 | ehrenberg2010 | ezzamel2002 | flusser2007 | flusser1986 | flusser2011a | flusser1990 | flusser1999 | flusser2011b | flusser2005 | flusser2004 | foucault1998 | foucault2001 | foucault1977 | frege1980 | galloway2007 | groys2008 | heidegger2002 | heidegger1992 | james2007 | kaplan2000 | king2007 | king2000 | kirsch2007 | kirsch1958 | kittler1999 | kittler1996 | klee1927 | koch2013 | kress2005 | kress2004 | Latin2004 | locke1996 | malabou2012 | marx1970 | mckenzie1999 | merchant2007 | palfrey2008 | pierce1974 | peters2011 | plutarch2011 | posner1998 | prensky2001 | ranci•À_re1995 | ranci•À_re2004 | ricoeur1990 | ritzer2010 | samuels2008 | serres1982 | sheely2008 | sommer2012 | stiegler1998 | sturm2012 | sturmandturner2012 | sturmandturner2011 | sturmandturner2013 | suarezvilla2009 | thomas2011 | toffler1980 | toscano2008 | virilio1991 | virilio2007 | virno2008 | wardripfruin2008 | whitehead1997 | wittgenstein1953 | wittgenstein2001 | wurth2006,88,1,174.7691073,-36.8523378,new zealand,Education,Education,new/digital media studies | media studies | media history [history of the book]170,"Suzuki, Takafumi | Hosoya, Mai",2014,suzuki2014,isolate_18,isolate_4095,0,Computational Stylistic Analysis of Popular Songs of Japanese Female Singer-songwriters,Toyo University | Toyo University,Japan | Japan,"This study analyzes popular songs composed by Japanese female singer-songwriters. Popular songs are a good representation of modern culture and society. Songs by female singer-songwriters account for a large portion of the current Japanese hit charts and particularly play an important role in understanding the Japanese language and communication style. In this study, we applied new methods of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The results clearly show differences in the characteristics of 10 female singer-songwriters, and we found that the visualization of the lyrics is a typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters.

Its argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the development of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and for the electronic medium. Narrative in the Dynamo! is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical writing. The Dynamo! develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the Dynamo! Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter.

He and his colleagues wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area. They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was called Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it.

By the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital humanities.

Like many other digital libraries, it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincoln•À_•À_s life and times in antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincoln•À_•À_s own papers, the project•À_•À_s databases contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly community and students.

Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanists•À_•À_•À_illuminated manuscripts, artists•À_•À_ books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated children•À_•À_s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media.

Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives,Scripps College,United States of America,"This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment of digital literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to do such work. Using the Women Writers Project and The Orlando Project as exemplary instances of digital literary scholarship, I discuss possible sites of feminist intervention (content, technological politics, labor structures,etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities. Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving women•À_•À_s work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,balzas2000 | bauerrhoades1996 | beck1998 | bianco2012 | booth2008 | brown | brown2005 | brown2010 | brown2007 | buzzetti2009 | craig2011 | davidson2008 | earhart2012 | ezell2010 | flanders2006 | flanders2007c | flanders2011 | flandersfiormonte2007 | flanderswernimont2010 | flower1994 | fraiman2008 | fraser2009 | freshwater2003 | hall2003 | haraway1991 | juhasz2010 | juhasz2011 | kaplanrose1993 | ketelaar2006 | latour2004 | latour2005 | liu2011 | liu2012 | mcpherson2012 | orlando1997 | orlando2007 | peck1993 | renear2001 | rooney2006 | rowe-finkbeiner2004 | rosser2005 | schaffer1998 | skloot2011 | smith2007 | spiro2012 | steedman2002 | travitsky2009 | wajcman1991 | wajcman2010 | wwp,50,1,-117.710379,34.1042118,united states,English,Language & Linguistics,gender studies | digital archives | digital literary studies | interface and user experience design | collaboration | literary studies | digital humanities - nature and significance147,"Wharton, Robin",2013,wharton2013,community_4,community_1,0,"Digital Humanities, Copyright Law, and the Literary",Independent Scholar, ,"Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we often encounter a quaint, and perhaps na•À_ve definition of the literary around which the law has crystallized and which has the potential to influence the work of all digital humanists, whether they think of themselves as literary scholars or not. The first part of this article explores how a relatively narrow definition of the literary as a category of high or belletristic cultural production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly defines literary works as any works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied . US courts have, however, often employed a narrower, more commonplace understanding of the literary as an aesthetic category when sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The second section of the article considers some of the potential implications and consequences of the current regulatory structure for the work of digital humanists. Judges engaging in a fair use analysis more often than not expect scholarship to come packaged in print monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that depart from those formal expectations and draw from pre-existing work, judges are less likely to find the use of pre-existing work is fair and therefore non-infringing. Finally, the article examines whether the literary as a category should be abandoned altogether, or whether digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that govern academic work.",Digital Humanities Quarterly,baker1879 | graham2006 | blanch2006 | boateng2011 | boyle1996 | boyle2008a | cambridge2012 | castle1998 | copyright1831 | copyright1870 | feist1991 | folsom1841 | herrington2001a | johns2009 | kelly2003 | kirsch2010 | kurtz1986 | latour2010a | lessig2004a | leval1990 | liu2011c | mla2012 | oed2012 | patterson1991 | price2008 | ramsay2011a | ramsay2011b | schofield2010 | shipley1986 | shipley2007 | stowe1853 | suntrust2001 | surwillo2007 | copyrighted2010 | constitution | vaidhyanathan2001 | woodmansee1984,37,1,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,Digital Humanities,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",copyright and licensing | literary studies | digital humanities - nature and significance | digital humanities - institutional support | digital scholarship | teaching and pedagogy | authorship attribution / authority | open access5,"Wolff, Mark",2007,wolff2007,community_7,community_3,0,Reading Potential: The Oulipo and the Meaning of Algorithms,Hartwick College,United States of America,"Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind.

The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario. Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning. At the moment, to the author•À_•À_s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published.
